 GLF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Lakes Confederation is isolated, landlocked, and divided. During the Great War chief Nixkamich chose to attack Canada and the United States, a bloodless coup ended the fascist regime of Nixkamich and replaced him with his peaceful brother Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh. Nixkamich was imprisoned in Canada and Canadian companies were allowed to set up shop in Confederation territory. \n\nThe Confederation is on the precipice of greatness, and freedom but also on precipice of chaos, and violence."
