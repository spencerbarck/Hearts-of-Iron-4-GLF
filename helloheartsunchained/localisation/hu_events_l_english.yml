 glf.1.title:0 "The Chief and the Radio"
 glf.1.d:0 "For the first time ever Chief Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh addressed the Confederation on the radio tonight. All across the Great Lakes from Minnesota to Ontario citizens listened as the champion of the gentle side addressed the people's concerns. Following the chiefs address members from every tribe elected representative to give a speech these tribes included the Ojibwe, Ottawa, Heuron, Shawnee, Miami, Winnebago, Potawatomi, Illinois, Fox Menominee, and many others including the Iroquois Confederation, and exiled tribes from European occupied lands. Finally after what seemed like a marathon of speeches Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh returned to conclude the event his last words moving the Confederation."

 glf.13.t:0 "Operation Dark Feather"
 glf.13.d:0 "The operation to free the former chief of the Confederation is ready. Tribes friendly to us living in Canadaian territory have sheltered our most elite soldiers, these brave warriors will face insurmountable odds assaulting the prison and escaping with the dark chief. For weeks of planning military strategists have debated the best way to get the chief back across the border, they have decided that while it may be risky a seaplane will be stationed nearby and if Nixkhamich is freed from his prison he will be airlifted back to our borders. If this mission fails we will likely never get a second chance and our relations with Canada will further sour."

 glf.14.t:0 "Operation Success"
 glf.14.d:0 "Nixkhamich is free! In the dead of night our brave warriors surprised the prison guards and located where Nixkhamich was being held.

Everything seemed to be going according the plan, the prison guards were surprised, Nixkhamich was freed, but then a Canadian garrison intercepted our forces and during the ensuing firefight Nixkhamich was shot. Our forces retreated with his body. Tribes across the Confederation are silent today as they mourn for this controversial yet strong figure."

 glf.15.t:0 "Trial of the free Nixkamich"
 glf.15.d:0 "Nixkhamich stands before the Confederation charged with warmongering and sabotage of foreign relations.

During his 20 year reign as Chief of the Confederation he increased the size and power of our armed forces, cut what little ties we had to the Europeans, and left a permanent mark on our reputation with the world by invading Canada and the United States while their forces were occupied by the war in Europe.
